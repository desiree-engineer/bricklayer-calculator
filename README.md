🧱 Bricklayer Calculator

A practical and beginner-friendly Python calculator designed to help bricklayers and construction workers perform common measurements easily.
This project is part of my Python learning journey and focuses on real-world utility and clean code development.

✨ Features

✔ Area Calculation (m²)

✔ Volume Calculation (m³)

✔ Brick Quantity Estimation

✔ Inclination/Slope Calculation

✔ Unit Conversions:

   ↳ cm → m
   
   ↳ m → cm
   
   ↳ m² → cm²
   
   ↳ cm² → m²


 🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x

Basic I/O with input()

Conditionals (if/elif/else)

Numeric calculations

Console-based menu system


🚀 How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/desiree-engineer/bricklayer-calculator.git
